# Highway Model Example
This DBT Model example has a few advanced bits of metadata added to the models and schemas. This is because Highway environments require metadata such as data classification to be attached to newly created tables. You will notice `meta` configuration parameters in these models that achieve this. Currently you do not need to worry about this in sandbox environments
